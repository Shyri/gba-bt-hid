## GBA Bluetooth HID ##
This project purpose is to convert a Game Boy Advance into a Bluetooth HID device.
Three steps are needed to achieve this:

### Task List ###
[DONE] 1. Enable an HC-05 device to behave as Bluetooth HID and learn how to use it. 

[DONE] 2. Make a small program to load a GBA rom using multiboot through link cable port.

[TODO] 3. Write a GBA program that communicates with HC-05 through link cable port to manage bluetooth connections and HID commands


More documentation to be added when finished.
